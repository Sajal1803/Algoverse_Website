            <h1>What is Heap Data Structure ? </h1><br> Heap is a special tree-based data structure where the tree is
            always a complete binary tree. <br> Heaps are of two types: Max heap and Min heap. <br>In the case of the max-heap,
            the root node will have a higher value than its subtree, and for the min-heap, the root node will have a
            lower value than its subtree.<br><br><br>

            <h2>Operations of Heap Data Structure:</h2> <br>

            <b>1. Heapify:</b> A process of creating a heap from an array. <br>
            <b>2. Insertion:</b> Process to insert an element in existing heap time complexity O(log N). <br>
            <b>3. Deletion:</b> Deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then
            organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N). <br>
            <b>4. Peek:</b> To check or find the most prior element in the heap, (max or min element for max and min
            heap).<br> <br> <br>

            <h3>Types Of Heap Data Structure:</h3> <br>
            Generally, Heaps can be of two types: <br>
            <b>1. Max-Heap:</b> In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present
            at all of it's children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
            <br>
            <b>2. Min-Heap:</b> In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at
            all of it's children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree. <br>
            <br> <br>

            <h3>Advantages of Heap Data Structure:</h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="bp"><span>Less time complexity, for inserting or deleting an element in the heap the time complexity is just O(logN).</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>It helps to find the minimum number and greatest number.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>To just peek at the most prior element the time complexity is constant O(1).</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Can be implemented using an array, it doesn't need any extra space for pointer.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heap can be created with O(N) time.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>A binary heap is a balanced binary tree, and easy to implement.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heaps can be used to implement a priority queue.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heaps are efficient for large data sets. </span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>The memory is dynamically allocated. </span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Ability to efficiently find the minimum and the maximum element. </span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Used in graph algorithms such as Dijkstra and A* search algorithms. </span></li>
            </ul><br><br> <br>

            <h3>Disadvantages Of Heap Data Structure:</h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="bp"><span>The time complexity for searching an element in Heap is O(N).</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>To find a successor or predecessor of an element, the heap takes O(N) time, whereas BST takes only O(log N)
                    time.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>To print all elements of the heap in sorted order time complexity is O(N*log N), whereas, for BST, it takes
                    only O(N) time.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Memory management is more complex in heap memory because it is used globally. Heap memory is divided into
                    two parts-old generations and the young generation etc. at java garbage collection.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Not suitable for small datasets.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Complex implementation.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Traversing is not easy as we need to remove the top element in order to access the rest of the elements. </span></li>
            </ul>  <br><br> <br>

            <h3>Application of Heap Data Structure:</h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heap is used to construct a priority queue.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heap sort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms with time complexity of O(N* log(N), and it's easy to implement.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Best First Search (BFS) is an informed search, where unlike the queue in Breadth-First Search, this
                    technique is implemented using a priority queue.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heaps can be used to efficiently maintain the median element in a constantly updating data set. </span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heaps can be used in the construction of Huffman coding trees.</span></li>
                <li class="bp"><span>Heap data structures are used in memory management to efficiently allocate and deallocate memory blocks.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <br> <br>

            <h3>Real-Time Application of Heap:</h3> <br>
            1. Patient treatment: In a hospital, an emergency patient, or the patient with more injury is treated first.
            Here the priority is the degree of injury. <br><br>
            2. Systems concerned with security use heap sort, like the Linux kernel. <br><br>
